      <p className="text-lg mb-6 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
        I have 5 years of experience as a dedicated Frontend React developer and nearly 10 years in software development, including a previous role as a FullStack developer with Java on the backend.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg mb-6 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
        At Qredo LTD, I contributed to decentralized asset management solutions by developing a reusable React components library and a transaction approval system using Material UI, Websockets, and Zod. This streamlined the development process, improving consistency across projects. Before that, at Tipico LTD, I migrated the frontend from Java JSP to React and implemented a real-time sports betting system using Stomp client/SockJs technologies, significantly improving performance and user experience.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
        I am enthusiastic about new challenges and opportunities, eager to acquire new knowledge and learn new technologies. I firmly believe that a good software developer never stops learning.
